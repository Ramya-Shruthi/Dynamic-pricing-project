# Dynamic-pricing-project
S – Situation:
“In my Dynamic Pricing project, the goal was to understand how price, discounts, and customer behavior affect the total amount a customer pays. Traditional fixed pricing doesn’t always capture these patterns, so I wanted to analyze historical sales to uncover insights.”
T – Task:
“My task was to clean and prepare the sales data, create meaningful features, and analyze patterns to support better pricing decisions.
A – Action:
“I worked with over 200,000 historical sales records, including product, customer, and transaction details. I cleaned the data, handled missing values, and standardized categories. Then I engineered features such as discounted price, total revenue, temporal variables like month and day of the week, customer metrics like average spend per customer, product metrics like sales count per product, and interaction features like Price × Quantity and Discount × Price. I also created dashboards to visualize trends and insights clearly.”
R – Result:
“This work helped me identify patterns in customer purchasing behavior and product performance. It also strengthened my skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, and turning business problems into structured analysis.
